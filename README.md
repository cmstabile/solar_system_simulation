Solar System Simulation
Description
This program simulates the solar system by animating the orbits of the planets around the Sun, illustrating gravitational interactions and visualizing their paths over the course of one Earth year. The simulation provides an engaging way to explore the dynamics of our solar system.

Features
Visual representation of the Sun and all major planets.
Animation of planetary orbits, showing their movements and trails over time.
Gravitational calculations to simulate realistic interactions between celestial bodies.
Optimized for running in PyCharm, leveraging the capabilities of Python libraries.
Requirements
To run this program, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
Clone this repository or download the main.py file.
Open the project in PyCharm.
Run the program from PyCharm.
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Code Overview
The code initializes the properties of the Sun and planets, computes gravitational forces, and animates their movements using matplotlib. The simulation runs for one Earth year, with the animation speed adjustable via the interval setting.
